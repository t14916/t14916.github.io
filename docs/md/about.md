# About myself
    
Hi there, welcome to my blog! I'm Tushar, a ~20 year old engineer that lives in California. I have a wide range of interests (in my opinion, too wide) which will likely mean that posts on here will vary in content from anime reviews to commentaries on Buddhist sutras. Maybe one day I'll even have the guts to post some fiction. This is the end of the about me, so go on! Read to your heart's content (or don't).
