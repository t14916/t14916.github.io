I've been spending a lot of time thinking about Buddhism recently. Having just graduated from university, I've lost access to the myriad of Buddhist Studies classes that I really want to take, and thus have to start my journey self studying. As such, over time I have compiled a nice list of Buddhist texts that I will be reading through and analyzing each of them one by one (hopefully with an accompanying blog post).

It should be noted that I'm no expert of Buddhism. I've taken / audited a few college classes, and have read some texts. I also practice Chan / Zen Buddhism, which is the perspective from which I am writing this article. That being said, I've thought a lot about these topics, and want to write some guidelines and elaborate on foundational Buddhist contexts which can help in understanding Buddhist ideas for a complete beginner.

Given that the Western (Europe / Americas, and even to an extent the Middle East) culture shares different origins than Buddhism, most people who grow up in the West have a very specific idea of what constitutes a faith or religion. This is largely due to the pervasive nature of Abrahamic religions. For this reason people associate religions with:

- **Idea of God / gods**
- **Creation of the world**
- **Belief in a soul / afterlife**

However, this isn't necessarily true in Buddhism. While Buddhism can (and often does) have some religious components, they are quite different than what those who follow Abrahamic religions are used to. I'll respond to the above list below:

- Buddhism is nontheistic. Yes, there are technically deities in Buddhist cosmology. In the sutras you will see mentions of the same gods as Hinduism, and as it moved throughout Asia you'll various deities from various local folk religions pop up. However, there is no reverence to these deities. Their existence may be acknowledged, but you do not pray to these deities. Moreover, the Buddha himself is not a god, and it is not necessary revere him as such. Instead, he is treated more like a teacher / master that we can learn from.
- Buddhism does not deal with creation much. Personally I have never ever seen, read or been told about creation from a Buddhist perspective. It is largely unconcerned with this, since it doesn't matter.
- One of the major differences between Buddhism and other religions which originate in India is the idea of *anatman*, or the lack of self / soul. There is no continual soul that exists before and continues after one's life. While there is belief in reincarnation, and even some form of afterlife (referring to the Pure Land), the way in which this works is pretty complex, and is more tangential to the real point of Buddhism (at least from a Chan perspective), which is the practice

## **What is Buddhism Really?**

When trying to explain a vast topic to someone else, it is very natural for people to try and simplify and distill the topic down to make it easier to absorb. However, the issue with this (as is the case when people try and talk about Hinduism as monolith), is that Buddhism is incredibly diverse. As I learned more and more about all the different flavors of it that have popped up throughout Asia, I've realized that it isn't really accurate to treat Buddhism as a single entity, but rather a cultural family. As such, different types of Buddhism will have contrasting view points about many issues.

However, being a family, there are certain core themes that are present (and emphasized to varying degrees) throughout.

## The 4 Noble Truths

1. **The Presence of Dukkha:** Dukkha can be understood as "suffering." Everyone will face some sort of suffering in life.
2. **The Root of Dukkha:** There is a cause to the suffering experienced by everyone.
3. **The Cessation of Dukkha:** There is a way to end this suffering.
4. **The Path to the Cessation of Dukkha:** There exists an attainable path to end this suffering.

These central ideas are common thread in all forms of Buddhism, which is offered as the path to end this suffering. Of course, there are different schools of thought as to what path is, and what the right way to practice Buddhism are to achieve this. In a very general sense, this path is described by the Eightfold Path:

1. Right View
2. Right Intention
3. Right Speech
4. Right Action
5. Right Livelihood
6. Right Effort
7. Right Mindfulness
8. Right Concentration

This description is emphasized in differently across schools, each with their own interpretation. In the Chan school I belong to, the Eightfold Path is rarely mentioned and is often not elaborated further, since there is the belief that focusing on mindfulness and meditation will lead to a very natural abidance to the Eightfold Path.

## Upaya

In describing Buddhism until now, I've been purposefully being vague in my descriptions. This is to reflect the reality of Buddhism, which is the fact the Buddhism is extremely diverse, by design. You see, as Buddhism spread throughout Asia, it adapted to fit the local cultural contexts. If we were to sample Buddhism, for example, in Nepal, China, and Japan, you can immediately see differences which stem in the local culture. 

In Nepal, you'll see many Vajrayana temples sport imagery of the *vajra*. This *vajra* originated as a thunderbolt weapon wielded by the lord Indra in *Rigveda*, the oldest of a set of important religious texts in Hinduism called the vedas, and was adopted by Buddhists to represent the nature of reality. This symbolism also travels to China and Japan, but originated in Nepal and India, the birthplace of Buddhism and Hinduism alike.

Traveling to China, you'll still find many mentions of deities, symbols, etc. that originated in India, but you'll also find new additions. For example, in the Chan center I attend, on both sides of the Buddha statue on the altar stand 2 Chinese deities, Guan Yin and ___. In fact, if you take a close look at Chinese Buddhism, you'll see how Daoism and folk culture mingled with Buddhism.

At our final destination of Japan, while the Buddhism is highly derivative of the Chinese Buddhism it originated from, it exists in a healthy co-existence with Shinto. Many times, you'll see Shinto Shrines and Buddhist Temples stand side by side. There is even a popular saying about Japan, that people are "born Shinto, die Buddhist" (I'm omitting the "marry Christian" which is often placed between the two ends). Both Buddhism and Shinto play important, but distinct, roles in Japanese Religious life. In fact, if you check up on statistics of various surveys, etc. (like the CIA World Factbook) on Japanese Religion, you'll come up with total percentages > 100%, since many Japanese practice both Shinto and Buddhism.

Anyway, the point of describing all of these cases is to show that Buddhism is malleable, and has changed both spatially (regarding Geography) and temporally. This is because of an important concept called *Upaya*, often translated as expedient means. Essentially, this describes the way in which the teachings of Buddhism can adapt for an audience. Buddhism recognizes that people come from all sorts of different cultural backgrounds, have different predispositions. Some teachings may suit one practitioner, whereas other people will gravitate towards others. As such, the Buddhist approach for this, rather than forcing conformity, is to provide variety and adapt teachings to the students.

While I've explored this on a greater scale (in noting how Buddhism has adapted through different cultures), it's also at play in the interpersonal level. My own Shifu often utilizes *Tea Chan*, in which he teaches Chan meditation and practice methods through through drinking tea. Moreover, in many Koans, Chan Masters can be observed giving different, often contradictory, answers to the same questions. This is because, in the spirit of Upaya, the masters tailor their answers to the specific situation to the student.

Upaya often isn't talked about in many introductions to Buddhism. Instead, people tend to focus more on the 4 ~~Noble~~ Truths, the Eightfold Path, or topics I haven't covered thus far, such as Karma. However, when I first started exploring the vast world of Buddhism, the single idea that stuck out to me the most was Buddhism. In looking for spirituality in my adult life, I often felt forced to believe or think a certain way. Of course, when exploring various faiths, there is an expectation across them to, well, have faith in the some central doctrine. Buddhism explicitly avoids this with the idea of Upaya. While all Buddhist schools require you to have some confidence in the master and their teachings, as well as adherence to some form of practice, it feels less forceful. There is no idea of "follow our teachings or you'll go to hell!" Instead, Buddhism shows you a problem that undeniably exists (suffering) and lays out a path to help you in life. When and where you take that first step, is up to you.

### A short explanation of the title

I thought I'd have a short explanation on the title, since I thought it was somewhat clever (especially since I am genuinely terrible at writing titles). If you ever visit a Chan temple, you'll often walk through a gate. These gates at the front of Chan (and perhaps other) types of Buddhism hold a strong symbolic value, representing an entrance to the Chan Path. Another example is the most famous collection of koan, *Mumonkan*, which is often translated to "Gateless Gate" or "Gateless Barrier". If you ever read Mahayana texts, you'll also see that there is many mentions of "the One Bright Pearl" (read the *Genjo Koan* to see one such mention). I combined the two to create the "Pearly Gates", which happen to also symbolize heaven in Christianity. If heaven is supposedly a place where all suffering ceases, then to me following Buddhism would be the best way to reach it.
