          <p>I’ve been spending a lot of time thinking about
          Buddhism recently. Having just graduated from university,
          I’ve lost access to the myriad of Buddhist Studies
          classes that I really want to take, and thus have to
          start my journey self studying. As such, over time I have
          compiled a nice list of Buddhist texts that I will be
          reading through and analyzing each of them one by one
          (hopefully with an accompanying blog post).</p>
          <p>It should be noted that I’m no expert of Buddhism.
          I’ve taken / audited a few college classes, and have read
          some texts. I also practice Chan / Zen Buddhism, which is
          the perspective from which I am writing this article.
          That being said, I’ve thought a lot about these topics,
          and want to write some guidelines and elaborate on
          foundational Buddhist contexts which can help in
          understanding Buddhist ideas for a complete beginner.</p>
          <p>Given that the Western (Europe / Americas, and even to
          an extent the Middle East) culture shares different
          origins than Buddhism, most people who grow up in the
          West have a very specific idea of what constitutes a
          faith or religion. This is largely due to the pervasive
          nature of Abrahamic religions. For this reason people
          associate religions with:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Idea of God / gods</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Creation of the world</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Belief in a soul / afterlife</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p>However, this isn’t necessarily true in Buddhism.
          While Buddhism can (and often does) have some religious
          components, they are quite different than what those who
          follow Abrahamic religions are used to. I’ll respond to
          the above list below:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Buddhism is nontheistic. Yes, there are technically
            deities in Buddhist cosmology. In the sutras you will
            see mentions of the same gods as Hinduism, and as it
            moved throughout Asia you’ll various deities from
            various local folk religions pop up. However, there is
            no reverence to these deities. Their existence may be
            acknowledged, but you do not pray to these deities.
            Moreover, the Buddha himself is not a god, and it is
            not necessary revere him as such. Instead, he is
            treated more like a teacher / master that we can learn
            from.</li>
            <li>Buddhism does not deal with creation much.
            Personally I have never ever seen, read or been told
            about creation from a Buddhist perspective. It is
            largely unconcerned with this, since it doesn’t
            matter.</li>
            <li>One of the major differences between Buddhism and
            other religions which originate in India is the idea of
            <em>anatman</em>, or the lack of self / soul. There is
            no continual soul that exists before and continues
            after one’s life. While there is belief in
            reincarnation, and even some form of afterlife
            (referring to the Pure Land), the way in which this
            works is pretty complex, and is more tangential to the
            real point of Buddhism (at least from a Chan
            perspective), which is the practice</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="what-is-buddhism-really"><strong>What is Buddhism
          Really?</strong></h2>
          <p>When trying to explain a vast topic to someone else,
          it is very natural for people to try and simplify and
          distill the topic down to make it easier to absorb.
          However, the issue with this (as is the case when people
          try and talk about Hinduism as monolith), is that
          Buddhism is incredibly diverse. As I learned more and
          more about all the different flavors of it that have
          popped up throughout Asia, I’ve realized that it isn’t
          really accurate to treat Buddhism as a single entity, but
          rather a cultural family. As such, different types of
          Buddhism will have contrasting view points about many
          issues.</p>
          <p>However, being a family, there are certain core themes
          that are present (and emphasized to varying degrees)
          throughout.</p>
          <h2 id="the-4-noble-truths">The 4 Noble Truths</h2>
          <ol type="1">
            <li><strong>The Presence of Dukkha:</strong> Dukkha can
            be understood as “suffering.” Everyone will face some
            sort of suffering in life.</li>
            <li><strong>The Root of Dukkha:</strong> There is a
            cause to the suffering experienced by everyone.</li>
            <li><strong>The Cessation of Dukkha:</strong> There is
            a way to end this suffering.</li>
            <li><strong>The Path to the Cessation of
            Dukkha:</strong> There exists an attainable path to end
            this suffering.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>These central ideas are common thread in all forms of
          Buddhism, which is offered as the path to end this
          suffering. Of course, there are different schools of
          thought as to what path is, and what the right way to
          practice Buddhism are to achieve this. In a very general
          sense, this path is described by the Eightfold Path:</p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>Right View</li>
            <li>Right Intention</li>
            <li>Right Speech</li>
            <li>Right Action</li>
            <li>Right Livelihood</li>
            <li>Right Effort</li>
            <li>Right Mindfulness</li>
            <li>Right Concentration</li>
          </ol>
          <p>This description is emphasized in differently across
          schools, each with their own interpretation. In the Chan
          school I belong to, the Eightfold Path is rarely
          mentioned and is often not elaborated further, since
          there is the belief that focusing on mindfulness and
          meditation will lead to a very natural abidance to the
          Eightfold Path.</p>
          <h2 id="upaya">Upaya</h2>
          <p>In describing Buddhism until now, I’ve been
          purposefully being vague in my descriptions. This is to
          reflect the reality of Buddhism, which is the fact the
          Buddhism is extremely diverse, by design. You see, as
          Buddhism spread throughout Asia, it adapted to fit the
          local cultural contexts. If we were to sample Buddhism,
          for example, in Nepal, China, and Japan, you can
          immediately see differences which stem in the local
          culture.</p>
          <p>In Nepal, you’ll see many Vajrayana temples sport
          imagery of the <em>vajra</em>. This <em>vajra</em>
          originated as a thunderbolt weapon wielded by the lord
          Indra in <em>Rigveda</em>, the oldest of a set of
          important religious texts in Hinduism called the vedas,
          and was adopted by Buddhists to represent the nature of
          reality. This symbolism also travels to China and Japan,
          but originated in Nepal and India, the birthplace of
          Buddhism and Hinduism alike.</p>
          <p>Traveling to China, you’ll still find many mentions of
          deities, symbols, etc. that originated in India, but
          you’ll also find new additions. For example, in the Chan
          center I attend, on both sides of the Buddha statue on
          the altar stand 2 Chinese deities, Guan Yin and ___. In
          fact, if you take a close look at Chinese Buddhism,
          you’ll see how Daoism and folk culture mingled with
          Buddhism.</p>
          <p>At our final destination of Japan, while the Buddhism
          is highly derivative of the Chinese Buddhism it
          originated from, it exists in a healthy co-existence with
          Shinto. Many times, you’ll see Shinto Shrines and
          Buddhist Temples stand side by side. There is even a
          popular saying about Japan, that people are “born Shinto,
          die Buddhist” (I’m omitting the “marry Christian” which
          is often placed between the two ends). Both Buddhism and
          Shinto play important, but distinct, roles in Japanese
          Religious life. In fact, if you check up on statistics of
          various surveys, etc. (like the CIA World Factbook) on
          Japanese Religion, you’ll come up with total percentages
          &gt; 100%, since many Japanese practice both Shinto and
          Buddhism.</p>
          <p>Anyway, the point of describing all of these cases is
          to show that Buddhism is malleable, and has changed both
          spatially (regarding Geography) and temporally. This is
          because of an important concept called <em>Upaya</em>,
          often translated as expedient means. Essentially, this
          describes the way in which the teachings of Buddhism can
          adapt for an audience. Buddhism recognizes that people
          come from all sorts of different cultural backgrounds,
          have different predispositions. Some teachings may suit
          one practitioner, whereas other people will gravitate
          towards others. As such, the Buddhist approach for this,
          rather than forcing conformity, is to provide variety and
          adapt teachings to the students.</p>
          <p>While I’ve explored this on a greater scale (in noting
          how Buddhism has adapted through different cultures),
          it’s also at play in the interpersonal level. My own
          Shifu often utilizes <em>Tea Chan</em>, in which he
          teaches Chan meditation and practice methods through
          through drinking tea. Moreover, in many Koans, Chan
          Masters can be observed giving different, often
          contradictory, answers to the same questions. This is
          because, in the spirit of Upaya, the masters tailor their
          answers to the specific situation to the student.</p>
          <p>Upaya often isn’t talked about in many introductions
          to Buddhism. Instead, people tend to focus more on the 4
          <del>Noble</del> Truths, the Eightfold Path, or topics I
          haven’t covered thus far, such as Karma. However, when I
          first started exploring the vast world of Buddhism, the
          single idea that stuck out to me the most was Buddhism.
          In looking for spirituality in my adult life, I often
          felt forced to believe or think a certain way. Of course,
          when exploring various faiths, there is an expectation
          across them to, well, have faith in the some central
          doctrine. Buddhism explicitly avoids this with the idea
          of Upaya. While all Buddhist schools require you to have
          some confidence in the master and their teachings, as
          well as adherence to some form of practice, it feels less
          forceful. There is no idea of “follow our teachings or
          you’ll go to hell!” Instead, Buddhism shows you a problem
          that undeniably exists (suffering) and lays out a path to
          help you in life. When and where you take that first
          step, is up to you.</p>
          <h3 id="a-short-explanation-of-the-title">A short
          explanation of the title</h3>
          <p>I thought I’d have a short explanation on the title,
          since I thought it was somewhat clever (especially since
          I am genuinely terrible at writing titles). If you ever
          visit a Chan temple, you’ll often walk through a gate.
          These gates at the front of Chan (and perhaps other)
          types of Buddhism hold a strong symbolic value,
          representing an entrance to the Chan Path. Another
          example is the most famous collection of koan,
          <em>Mumonkan</em>, which is often translated to “Gateless
          Gate” or “Gateless Barrier”. If you ever read Mahayana
          texts, you’ll also see that there is many mentions of
          “the One Bright Pearl” (read the <em>Genjo Koan</em> to
          see one such mention). I combined the two to create the
          “Pearly Gates”, which happen to also symbolize heaven in
          Christianity. If heaven is supposedly a place where all
          suffering ceases, then to me following Buddhism would be
          the best way to reach it.</p>
