			    <p>I've been spending a lot of time thinking about Buddhism recently. Having just graduated from university, I've lost access to the myriad of Buddhist Studies classes that I really want to take, and thus have to start my journey self studying. As such, over time I have compiled a nice list of Buddhist texts that I will be reading through and analyzing each of them one by one (hopefully with an accompanying blog post). Since I'm now home for college, I've been talking to some old friends, one of which seemed particularly interested in reading more / learning about Buddhism.</p>
			    <p><b>Just a disclaimer before I get into any content, I am no expert. These are my own thoughts. My knowledge stems from a couple college courses I took in undergrad, only one of which was specifically about Buddhism. I also attended a Physics/Buddhist/Philosophy conference for a single day. I also like to think of myself as a Zen / Chan practitioner for the last few months, and am involved and plan to continue to be involved in my local Chan center. I've also read a fair share of Koans. But I am no expert, I am a layperson writing and intro for even layer-people. Also, when I say Buddhism, I am referring to Mahayana in particular, often Zen/Chan in particular. </b></p>

			    <p>Initially, I was ready to give him the readings I had compiled, which consist of some esoteric texts from Nagarjuna and Koans compiled by Dogen and Mumon. These texts are important in that there are good teachings embedded within them, but I quickly realized they may be uninteresting and/or unaccessible to those who lack the right language to understand what is going on. Even then, the very nature of these texts make them quite hard to decipher, and even the notion of condensing them to a single understanding would miss the point. There is also the question of whether or not this is the right place to even start to learn about Buddhism. The answer is probably not, which means that the audience for this post essentially just boils down to people who want to read koans or other texts without a backgroundin Buddhism for whatever reason. </p>
			    <p>There are a certain number of terms / ideas that I believe are important to penetrate the meaning of many of these texts, ranging from basic elements common across other Indic religions, to some things that are specific to Mahayana Buddhist discourse. </p> 
                            <h2 class="section-heading">Dukkha, and the 4 Noble Truths</h2>
			    <p>The Noble Truths are probably the best place to start with because this is the closest Buddhism gets to a central doctrine.</p>
			    <ol>
				<li><b>The Presence of Dukkha: </b>The term "dukkha" can be understood as "suffering." This truth is that everyone will face some sort of suffering in life.</li>
				<li><b>The Root of Dukkha: </b>This truth is that there is a cause to this suffering, no matter what it is.</li>
				<li><b>The Cessation of Dukkha: </b>This truth is that there is an end to suffering.</li>
				<li><b>The Path to the Cessation of Dukkha: </b>This truth is that there is an attainable path to end suffering.</li>
			    </ol>
			    <p>These ideas developed at the very beginning of Buddhism, and unlike certain other aspects of early Buddhism, persist throughout. I like to describe this as kind of the point of Buddhism, this is what you should expect Buddhist practice to do for you.</p>
                            <h2 class="section-heading">Karma, and the Cycle of Death and Rebirth</h2>
			    <p>This is something that most people are at least familiar with. In most Indic religions, there is the idea that one is born again after death, in another form. This form, as well as whatever happenings occur during a lifetime, is usually predicated on the Karmic situation of ones past lives. There are a couple of important consequences of this. First of all, no matter how well one behaves in the current life, there is no guarantee that nothing bad will happen. This is because there is a cumulative element to Karma that includes past lives. This is distinct from the western notion of karma, which is more of a "golden rule" type of scenario, where if you treat others well good things will happen to you. Karma in fact doesn't quite work this way.</p>
                            <h2 class="section-heading">Upaya, and the Parable of the Burning House</h2>
			    <p>One of the important ideas of Mahayana Buddhism in particular is that of upaya. To fully understand the meaning of the term, I would suggest searching up the "Parable of the Burning House," and giving that a read through. Essentially, upaya is the idea that everyone has their own path. Everyone is unique in their own way, and thus have unique predispositions to different ideas and teachings. What works for one person, may not work with another. Initially, the idea of upaya was used in describing the different paths of Buddhism, in terms of the 3 vehicles described in the aforementioned parable (seriously just go and read it). However, in my mind, the idea of upaya ingrains itself as a couple of different cultural phenomenas I have noticed in Mahayana Buddhism.</p>
			    <p>First of all, there is a culture of adaptation. There has always been a personal element, where monks and masters have leeway to sort of tailor teachings to the students that are presented to them. In my own case, the monk at my local Chan center (Shifu) chooses the vehicle of tea to help explain and allow students to internalize Zen/Chan teachings. Although tea itself is quite important within Buddhist culture, I doubt that it is used as a teaching method the way that Shifu uses it. In a larger scale, it can be seen in the diversification of Buddhism during the Kamakura period of Japan. During this period, the older predominant Tendai and Shingon schools of Buddhism were seen as corrupt and too esoteric to spread to the general population. This led to a diversification of Buddhist sects, some of which brought over from China. Zen, deriving from Chan in China, sought a more meditative focus and relied on sudden enlightenment. On the other hand, Pure Land sects rejected the idea that enlightenment in the current life was feasible for most people, and instead focused on rebirth into the "Pure Land" where enlightenment could be achieved. </p>
			    <p>The second cultural phenomena, I believe, is more separate from upaya but still relates to the "spirit" of upaya. This is the idea that there are no teachers in Buddhism. Not in the sense that there is no one that can teach you Buddhism, but in the sense that there is an expectation to do more than just imitating the teacher. This can be seen in various texts, such as the Vimalakirti Sutra which generalizes across Mahayana Buddhism, to being a central element to many Zen Koans. I think this is due to the uniqueness of both perception and experience in each person, the understandings of teachings differ between people due to differences in how they are contextualized within the mind. Therefore, simply copying the actions and words of another is not sufficient to truly understand and internalize Buddhist ideas and wisdom. In upaya, this is adapting the message of teachings to the audience, but in this cultural phenomena it can be thought of adapting the teaching for oneself. </p>
                            <h2 class="section-heading">WIP</h2>
			    <p>The above sections describe a miniscule fraction of the ideas needed to fully understand Buddhist readings. However, in my experience with Sutras, Koans, the Genjo Koan, and other texts I have read, these are the topics that I feel I have engaged with the most, or are absolutely necessary to understand even the basics of what is going on. Right now there are some really big omissions, which is why I'm keeping this post open as a continual WIP to expand over the course of however long this blog is active.</p>
